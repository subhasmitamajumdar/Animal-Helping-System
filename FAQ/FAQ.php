        <h1> First Aid questions to help animals</h1>
        <h2>Burns</h2>
<p>For thermal or electrical burns, immediately apply cool water compresses with a clean cloth to the site of the injury, changing them frequently as necessary to keep the site cool and wet. Continue this for at least 30 minutes.  
Transport your pet to a veterinary facility as soon as possible for further care.
<h4>Chemical burns</h4>
• Wash the contaminated area with large volumes of tepid flowing water for at least 15 minutes.</br>    
• If the chemical is in the eye, flush the eye with large volumes of water or contact lens saline for 15 minutes. </br>
• Seek veterinary attention as soon as possible. </p>
    <h2>Bleeding</h2>
    <h4>• Direct Pressure</h4>
    Gently press a compress over the bleeding area, so it can absorb the blood and allow it to clot. 
<h4>• Elevation</h4>
If a severely bleeding wound is on the foot or leg, gently elevate the leg so that the wound is above the level of the heart.This slows bleeding.
<h4>• Pressure on the Supplying Artery</h4>
If external bleeding continues after you have used direct pressure and elevation, use your finger or thumb to place pressure over the main artery to the wound.
<h4>• Tourniquet</h4>
Use of a tourniquet is potentially dangerous and it should be used only for a severe, life-threatening hemorrhage in a limb.</br>
<b> A tourniquet should only be used as a last-resort, life-saving measure!</b>
<h2>Eye injury</h2>
• If an irritating chemical or other product accidentally gets into the eye, flush it with running water.</br>
•Sponge homemade saline solution for a minimum of 15 minutes.</br>
• Always seek veterinary attention immediately.</br>
<h2>Fracture</h2>
• Stop bleeding with direct pressure. 
• Open fractures should be covered with a sterile gauze dressing (or use a clean cloth)if possible.</br> 
• If the pet can still use three legs, support the rear legs with a towel under the abdomen (with the ends held together above the back) used as a sling.</br>
• Do not flush the wound with saline or water as this only risks driving contaminants deeper into the wound.  </br>
• Never attempt to set or reduce a fracture or try to push a protruding bone back into position. </br>
<h2>When Your Pet Cannot Breathe</h2>
• Keep the pet and yourself calm.  </br>
• If the pet has choked on a foreign body, perform a finger sweep.   </br>
• Perform rescue breathing if necessary.   </br>
• If the pet is overheated, moisten the feet and ears with cool (not cold) water to promote heat exchange.</br>
• Seek veterinary assistance as soon as possible. </br>
